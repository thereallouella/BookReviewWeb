<h3>Book Review</h3>
<p>
    Are you an avid bookworm who loves to share what you thought of your latest read? Writing a book review is a great way to let fellow readers know about an exciting new page-turner—or give a heads up that a book might not meet expectations.

    Whether you’re reviewing a book on a site like Goodreads or on your personal blog, you’ll want your review to be informative and helpful for your audience.

<h3>The Purpose</h3>

<p>
    But what exactly the purpose of book review?
    A book review is a guide for potential readers. In a concise manner, a review summarizes the authors qualifications and main points, often providing examples from the text. A review also provides an opinion on whether the author succeeds or not in convincing readers of his or her points. It is a critical analysis of the material that describes, summarizes, and critiques the ideas presented. Also to broaden your knowledge base and understanding of a topic.
